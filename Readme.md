# StayPut Remixed

[Spigot Plugin Page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/stayput-remixed.69564/)

Return to your last location when teleporting back to a multiverse world

The Bukkit/Spigot Multiverse plugin always sends you to a world's spawn when teleporting to it.
This can be problematic for those who want to pick up where they last left off in a world. This 
plugin fixes that by keeping track of where users were last and sending them there when they return
to a world. 

For keeping track of different world inventories, I recommend using [perworldinventory](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/per-world-inventory.4482/).
