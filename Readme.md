# StayPut Remixed

Return to your last location when teleporting back to a multiverse world

The Bukkit/Spigot Multiverse plugin always sends you to a world's spawn when teleporting to it.
This can be problematic for those switching between worlds who want to pick up where they left off
when they return. This plugin fixes that by keeping track of where users were last and making sure
they spawn in the world there when they return.

I've mostly done bug fixes with the project so far but I'll eventually write up some documentation
on how to use it and how it differs from the original fork. I'll also be refactoring and trying to
make the codebase more consistent and readable.
